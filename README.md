# Movie browser

## Description

The app is running the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). It is possible to save selected titles to your favorites within the app, and also to rate the titles, whether you added them to favorites or not.
Both favorites and rated titles are saved in the local storage, so that when you return to the application, the favorites list and your ratings are still preserved.
The app was initially written in ReactJS, but I have since migrated it to typescript.
